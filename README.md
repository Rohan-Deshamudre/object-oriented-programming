- Sort the entire catalogue according to type (so first all iPhones, then all iPads) or price (from low to high)
- Allows to addnew configurations of existing products (e.g. with higher capacity memory or new colors) 
- Allows to write to file all product information (preserving the file format!).
- Write an equals() method for each class (except for the class that contains the main() method)
